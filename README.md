# New Livestream Directory
## [Link to Website](https://www.coreyheuvelsearch.com/)
This is a search tool I made for the Youtuber "Corey Heuvel" back in Summer 2022. Allows users to easily navigate thousands of livestream music performances. This website is currently being hosted on GitHub pages.

Here's a clip of Corey Heuvel talking about the Livestream Directory during one of his livestreams: [Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/live/bEBVkT9SWFY?feature=share&t=2937)

Note: I'm the "Michael L" being referred to, that's my Youtube username. The L doesn't stand for anything.

## Technologies Used
- Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- C# 
- JSON
- GitHub Pages
- Cloudflare
- Python
- SQLite

## Explanation of how this Works
- The new frontend was built using the **Vue** JavaScript framework.

- I used **C#** to make the algorithm. It was originally written in *[Python](https://github.com/MichaelT-178/Modern-Python-Files/blob/main/og_main_algorithm.py)* but I rewrote it in C# to improve code clarity and add new features. The purpose of the algorithm is to convert the db_manager/timestamps/[all-timestamps.txt](https://github.com/MichaelT-178/LivestreamDirectory/blob/main/db_manager/timestamps/all-timestamps.txt) file into the database/[song_list.json](https://github.com/MichaelT-178/LivestreamDirectory/blob/main/database/song_list.json) file. It basically turns the timestamps into a list of JSON song objects. I added a lot of new code to the algorithm to create the new JSON files used in this new website.

- **JSON** is the data format used in this project.

- **GitHub Pages** is where the website is being hosted.

- **Cloudflare** is how I configured the domain link for this site.

- **Python** is NOT directly used in the website. But I use it to convert the song_list.json file into a **SQLite** database. The **SQLite** database is just for viewing purposes and to query it using SQL. It's NOT being used by the website in anyway. I also use it to interact with the spotify api to download images.

## This is what the output of running the algorithm (basically) looks like

- *"That is purely amazing!!! Thanks Lord Michael!"*
- *"Really immense; thanks so much."*
- *"Holy wow, Michael, that is SUPER cool, thank you!"*

And one of my personal favorites from a Lenovo hiring manager:

- *"I use the S#%t out of that thing."*
